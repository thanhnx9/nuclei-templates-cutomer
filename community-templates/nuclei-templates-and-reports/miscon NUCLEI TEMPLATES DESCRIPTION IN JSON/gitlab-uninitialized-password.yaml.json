"vulnerability_description":"Prior to version 14, GitLab installations required a root password to be set via the web UI. If the administrator skipped this step, any visitor could set a password and control the instance.",
"vulnerability_remediation":"Pass the GITLAB_ROOT_PASSWORD environment variable to the installation command provided the hostname for the server is set up correctly. If during the installation GitLab doesn’t automatically perform a reconfigure, you have to pass the GITLAB_ROOT_PASSWORD variable to the first gitlab-ctl reconfigure run.",
